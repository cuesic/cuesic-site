<h2>4. Social Media Platforms</h2>
When you interact with our content on platforms like Instagram or TikTok, those platforms may collect data according to their own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for their data collection.

<h2>5. Sharing of Information</h2>
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
